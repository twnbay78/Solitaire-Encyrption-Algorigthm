# Solitaire-Encyrption-Algorigthm

The Solitaire cryptographic algorithm was designed by Bruce Schneier to allow field agents to communicate 
securely without having to rely on electronics or having to carry incriminating tools,[1] at the request of 
Neal Stephenson for use in his novel Cryptonomicon. It was designed to be a manual cryptosystem calculated 
with an ordinary deck of playing cards. In Cryptonomicon, this algorithm was originally called Pontifex to 
hide the fact that it involved playing cards.

One of the motivations behind Solitaire's creation is that in totalitarian environments, a deck of cards is 
far more affordable (and less incriminating) than a personal computer with an array of cryptological utilities. 
However, as Schneier warns in the appendix of Cryptonomicon, just about everyone with an interest in cryptanalysis 
will know about this algorithm.
